Hi! I am Aditya, a 5th year CS student and researcher at IIIT Hyderabad, India.

I work at the Computer Systems Group at IIIT-H, under the advice of <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=m8_F5SoAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Suresh Purini</a>. I am developing an urban digital twin framework that simulates vehicular and pedestrian traffic using probabilistic modeling and forecasted data. At its core, the framework integrates a Large Language Model (LLM), enabling users to query complex traffic scenarios using natural language commands.

<br>

I love all things functional programming, computer architecture and compilers[^1]. I am a big fan of NixOS[^2], a Linux distribution that relies on Nix for declarative and reproducible OS builds. 

<br>

My research work in city modeling has led to a recent interest in reading more about urban planning and architecture. Besides this, I adore films, and am probably seeing one right now (if I can find the time). I'm also fascinated by watchmaking and horology, specifically the mechanics behind different movements and complications.
