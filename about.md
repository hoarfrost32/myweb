I am Aditya Tejpaul, a 5th year CS student and researcher at IIIT Hyderabad, India.

I work at the Computer Systems Group at IIIT-H, under the advice of <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=m8_F5SoAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Suresh Purini</a>. My work focuses on building novel deep learning architectures & end-to-end pipelines for predictive analysis of complex genomic data. The key application is accelerating genomic selection to create more climate-resilient and productive crops.

I love all things functional programming, computer architecture, operating systems and compilers[^1]. I also love using (and telling everyone about) NixOS[^2], a linux distribution centered around the nix package manager, which itself is written in a purely functional language also called nix. When I'm not in front of a terminal, I'm probably watching a film or spending time with my cat.
